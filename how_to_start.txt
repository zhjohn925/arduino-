--Hardware and Software

Your learning will be enhanced if you purchase the recommended hardware for this course. 
I recommend the Arduino Uno Rev 3 Ultimate Starter Kit, which costs approximately 
$54.99 USD. 

http://www.vilros.com/ultimate-starter-kit.html 

You don't need to purchase any software but you will need to download the Arduino 
IDE for free from 

https://www.arduino.cc/

If you do not have an Arduino, you can use the web-based Arduino simulator at 

123d.circuits.io. 

You will need to create an account for free. There are instructional videos on 
that website that will teach you how to use the simulator.

--Set up the Arduino IDE
1. Download the IDE: www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
   - Also installs USB and other drivers
2. Connect the board to your computer
   - Use USB cable
3. Lauch the Arduino application
   - Starts the IDE
4. Open the Blink example:
   - File > Examples > Basics > Blink
5. Select your Arduino in the Tools > Board menu
6. Select your serial port in the Tools > Port menu
   - There should be only one selection (COM3 etc)
7. Upload the program with the upload button
   - This writes the program onto the Flash of the Arduino
8. The LED near pin 13 of the Arduino should blink.
