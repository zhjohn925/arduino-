--Hardware and Software

Your learning will be enhanced if you purchase the recommended hardware for this course. 
I recommend the Arduino Uno Rev 3 Ultimate Starter Kit, which costs approximately 
$54.99 USD.

You don't need to purchase any software but you will need to download the Arduino 
IDE for free from 

https://www.arduino.cc/

If you do not have an Arduino, you can use the web-based Arduino simulator at 

123d.circuits.io. 

You will need to create an account for free. There are instructional videos on 
that website that will teach you how to use the simulator.
